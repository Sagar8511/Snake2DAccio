Project Description: Snake Game Development Using Java Swing

The Snake Game project focuses on developing a classic arcade game using the Java Swing library. Players will control a snake and aim to eat food while avoiding obstacles and collisions with the snake's own body. The game will feature a simple and intuitive user interface with a frame encapsulating the game content. The content pane will display game elements like the snake, food, and obstacles. The background color and dimensions will be set to enhance the visual experience.

To improve the game's graphics, images will be loaded for the snake, food, and additional visual elements. These images will be drawn on the content pane at their respective positions, creating an engaging game environment. The mechanics of the snake will enable its movement and interaction with food. Players will control the snake using arrow keys, allowing them to navigate it across the game area. The snake's size will increase upon consuming food, and the player's score will reflect their progress.

Collision detection will play a crucial role in maintaining the game's challenge. Collisions between the snake and the game boundaries, as well as collisions with the snake's own body, will be checked. If a collision occurs, the game will end, and a game over message will be displayed. The player's score will be continuously displayed on the screen, providing feedback on their performance.
